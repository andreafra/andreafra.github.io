This is ancient history.

CAHOnline was my and [aleasto](https://github.com/aleasto) take on a web port of the famous Cards Against Humanity. We used it as an occasion to test AngularJS (deprecated a long time ago) and Socket.io in a small project. We targeted both desktops and smartphones, with a responsive minimal design. With some occasional bug due to player disconnections or CSS vendor-related glitches, the final result was surprisingly playable.

A demo is unfortunately no longer available because of the outdate software, but it should be easy to spin up locally.
