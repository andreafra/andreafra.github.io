As part of my master thesis, I've been working on PIACERE project with prof. [Matteo Pradella](https://pradella.faculty.polimi.it) and [Michele Chiari](https://michiari.github.io).

[PIACERE](https://www.piacere-project.eu) is a **DevSecOps** framework running on Eclipse (ðŸ¤®) that features its own high-level, provider-indipendent IaC language called [DOML](https://www.piacere-doml.deib.polimi.it), developed at Polimi, too. 

I continued the previous work of Michele Chiari and Michele De Pascalis on a **Model Checker** that uses the **Z3 SMT solver** to verify that the DOML model satisfies structural and architectural requirements. In particular I developed a **Domain Specific Language** to let users write custom requirements in first-order logic, and prototyped **synthesis of IaC** through an SMT solver, basically generating a complete model starting from an incomplete one. 

I've been maintaining the tool, since November 2022 till the end of the project in November 2023.
