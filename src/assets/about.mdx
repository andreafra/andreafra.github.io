I'm a software engineer based in Milan, Italy.

I'm currently a Research Fellow at the _Politecnico di Milano_, where I got my master's degree. I work with [Prof. Matteo Pradella](https://pradella.faculty.polimi.it/), [Michele Chiari](https://michiari.github.io/) and Michele De Pascalis on the topic of _Verification of Infrastructure-as-Code_.

I'm also the maintainer of the verification tool of [project PIACERE](https://piacere-project.eu/), an EU-sponsored DevSecOps framework through the Horizon 2020 program.

## Skills

I pick up new stuff very quickly, and so during the last {yearsCoding} years, I've found myself tinkering with many technologies. I've been working and exploring various frontend frameworks (React, Svelte, Vue and Angular), as well as various backend solutions (Express, Koa, Hono, Sequelize, Prisma, Websockets, Serverless Functions).

I had a brief experience of programming for iOS both with Swift and React Native, too.

More recently, I'm experimenting with concurrent programming with Elixir and Phoenix.

I've also a fairly good knowledge of game development and design, as well as experience with [Unity](https://unity.com/) and [Godot](https://godotengine.org/). I've also dealt with WebGL for a university project.
