I'm a software engineer based in Milan, Italy.

I'm work in the  Digital Transition Strategy and Integration Framework team at _Politecnico di Milano_, ICT Services, where I also got my master's degree. 

Previously, I've work as a Researcher with [Matteo Pradella](https://pradella.faculty.polimi.it/), [Michele Chiari](https://michiari.github.io/) and [Michele De Pascalis](https://github.com/mikidep/). on the topic of _Verification of Infrastructure-as-Code_.

I've held the [exercise sessions](https://github.com/andreafra/ppl) for the 2023/24 [_Principles of Programming Languages_](https://pradella.faculty.polimi.it/PL.html) class at Polimi, showcasing Scheme/Racket, Haskell and Erlang.

I've been the maintainer of the verification tool of [project PIACERE](https://piacere-project.eu/), an EU-sponsored DevSecOps framework through the Horizon 2020 program.
