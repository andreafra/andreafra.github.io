This is a relatively smaller project compared to the others, and nothing particularly complicated.

This was my first experience with **Java EE**, and I must say that it's a PITA to setup a TomEE server, especially when compared to Node/Python. The project had some pretty weird constraints on it (mostly the tech stack/some components design structure) and it was merely a glorified exercise.

Again, we setup the Database via Docker.

It consisted mostly of a web app to let users register, fill up questionnaires/forms, and display the results.

I learned what an ORM is at least.
